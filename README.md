# Aggregate Streaming Trades.
C++ code to generate statistics from streaming trades coming from a stock exchange.

### Input:
The input file represents a stream of trades on an exchange.  
Each row represents a trade, the data in which can be thought of as a time series of values in columns: 

TimeStamp,  Symbol,  Quantity,  Price

### Definitions:
- TimeStamp is value indicating the microseconds since midnight.
- Symbol is the 3 character unique identifier for a financial 
  instrument (Stock, future etc.)
- Quantity is the amount traded
- Price is the price of the trade for that financial instrument.

### Assumptions:
- TimeStamp is always for the same day and won't roll over midnight.
- TimeStamp is increasing or same as previous tick (time gap will never be < 0).
- Price - our currency is an integer based currency.  No decimal points.
- Price - Price is always > 0.

Example: here is a row for a trade of 10 shares of aaa stock at a price of 12 
1234567,aaa,10,12

### Implementation:
Find the following on a per symbol basis:
- Maximum time gap
  (time gap = Amount of time that passes between consecutive trades of a symbol)
  if only 1 trade is in the file then the gap is 0.
- Total Volume traded (Sum of the quantity for all trades in a symbol).
- Max Trade Price.
- Weighted Average Price.  Average price per unit traded not per trade.
  Result should be truncated to whole numbers.

  Example: the following trades
	20 shares of aaa @ 18
	5 shares of aaa @ 7
	Weighted Average Price = ((20 * 18) + (5 * 7)) / (20 + 5) = 15

### Output:
A file called 'output.csv', that should be a comma separate file with this format:
symbol,  MaxTimeGap,  Volume,  WeightedAveragePrice,  MaxPrice

The output should be sorted by symbol ascending ('aaa' should be first).

### Sample Input:

52924702,aaa,13,1136

52924702,aac,20,477

52925641,aab,31,907

52927350,aab,29,724

52927783,aac,21,638

52930489,aaa,18,1222

52931654,aaa,9,1077

52933453,aab,9,756

### Sample Output:

aaa,5787,40,1161,1222

aab,6103,69,810,907

aac,3081,41,559,638
